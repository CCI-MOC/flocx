# First Layer of Open Cloud eXchange
This system provides a marketplace that enables sharing and trading of bare-metal servers among non-trusting stake-holders. Every user of FLOCX is a tenant that owns some physical servers.
When not in use tenants can share their spare capacity of servers with FLOCX at a prescribed rate and for a desired duration. 
FLOCX will rent those servers to other tenants who need them at a price and for duration that is agreeable to both parties involved. 
FLOCX also manages the accounting related to renting of nodes.
