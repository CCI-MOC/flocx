# First Layer of the Open Cloud Exchange (FLOCX)

FLOCX provides a marketplace for trading physical servers among co-located
pools of hardware where each pool is owned and managed by independent
organizations.  Using FLOCX, organizations can rent nodes from their co-located
neighbors in times of high demand and offer their own resources at a suitable
price when others experience high demand.
