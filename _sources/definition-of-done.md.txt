# Definition of Done for the FLOCX Project

When is a user story on our planning board considered complete?

- All associated tasks are closed.

- If the work involves code or documentation, that code or documentation has
  been submitted via a GitHub pull request against the appropriate repository
  and the pull request has merged.

  (The corollary is that commit messages associated with the pull request
  should follow our [commit message best practices][]).

- If the work involves code, that code does not cause any existing tests to
  break.

- If the work involves code, that code is accompanied by tests that exercise
  any new or modified features.

- If the work involves code, any new tests must pass.
